Reflection on Project Management Tools

Using GitHub's project management features such as milestones, issues, and project boards has significantly improved the organization and collaboration within our team. 

Benefits:
- **Milestones** provide a clear vision of project phases and deadlines, helping the team prioritize tasks effectively.
- **Issues** allow us to document and categorize specific tasks, bugs, and feature requests, ensuring nothing is overlooked.
- **Project boards** offer a visual representation of progress, making it easier to track the status of each task and identify bottlenecks.

Challenges:
One challenge we anticipate is ensuring that all team members consistently update the project board. Effective communication and regular check-ins will be crucial to overcoming this.

Overall, these tools streamline workflows, enhance transparency, and foster better collaboration, making the project management process more efficient.
